# chirp
An immersive, proximity based voice chat. Ever join a voice channel full of people? You lose the ability to talk with a small group, or even one on one, without leaving the call. I want to change that. Chirp's goal is to create the ability to feel like you're actually in a room full of people, instead of going into separate rooms.
