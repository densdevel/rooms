# <strong>Rooms</strong>

##### In every room, everywhere you go, people get quieter the further away they are. Rooms aims to bring this key catalyst of socialization to the internet.

##### My hope for Rooms is for it to become an online sanctuary, designed to bring the experience of social gatherings to the web. 

##### Excited yet? Soon, you'll be able to create and join what will be called 'Houses'. A house will simply contain all your different rooms, each with their own message board. You can view it like a discord server, except it's more than that - it's a community. If this sounds overly complicated and hard to navigate, don't worry. The Rooms project is highly focused on functionality. I want to keep the charm of having an actual online house, while maintaining ease of use. Rooms is designed to be more than just a gimmick, it's designed to be fully functional and beautiful, while also being very easy to navigate to keep users doing more talking and less clicking. I will update the README once the project is complete, for now you can clone this repo and run 'npm run build' to try it out!
